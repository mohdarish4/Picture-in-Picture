# Picture-In-Picture

Picture-in-Picture (PiP) is like having a small video player on your screen that you can move around while doing other things on your device.

## Example 
Imagine you're watching a video on your phone. With PiP, you can shrink that video into a small window that stays on top of your screen. This way, you can continue watching the video even when you switch to other apps or do different tasks on your phone.
